## 💡 About Me

I'm a curious and creative developer who loves learning by building.  
From web design to mini game hacks, I've explored lots of fun tech tools — and I'm still learning more every day!

I’m currently diving into iOS development with **Swift**, and I enjoy experimenting with:

- 🐍 Python (mini tools, automation, game cheats 👀)
- 🌐 HTML + CSS (web design & styling fun)
- ⚡ Arduino (basic circuits + coding)
- 🎮 Java & Dart (dabbled for fun)
- 🧊 3D modeling & creative tech
